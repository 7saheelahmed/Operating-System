# Operating System-
This repository contains my work from  Operating System Classes.

There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which we are going to discuss in this chapter âˆ’

## First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
## Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling
## Priority Scheduling
## Shortest Remaining Time
## Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
## Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling

These algorithms are either ## non-preemptive or ## preemptive. Non-preemptive algorithms are designed so that once a process enters the running state, it cannot be preempted until it completes its allotted time, whereas the preemptive scheduling is based on priority where a scheduler may preempt a low priority running process anytime when a high priority process enters into a ready state.
